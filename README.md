# domain_1

This repository contains the first module of Shin-Lap self-transformative program. Need to prepare a mind, a brain, general perception and perspective to be able to do anything with other components of Monada Dominion.

Of course, only if you are interested in original idea. It is still possible to just open other domains, like domain_2 **Meditation** and test it without any preparation. 

The need in understanding theory will gradually emerge, while you progress through steps and domains. 

domain_3 cards will not open itself compeltely without domain_1 and domain_2, but you can always create something new. 

domain_4 is simply not visible or not available without knowledge of all thre previous. 

Further steps are obscured, but can be opened on demand.
