This repository houses the foundational materials for the **Monada Dominion** journey. Its purpose is to prepare your mind, brain, general perception, and perspective, which is crucial for engaging with the subsequent components of the system.

## 🗺️ Initial domains of Monada Dominion

It is a progressive journey structured into several domains. While you can explore some parts out of order, the intended path is designed for a gradual unfolding of understanding.

*   **🌀 Domain 1: The Dot - Mindfulness** (You are here)
    *   Essential preparation for the entire MD system - Shin-Lap mindfulness program.

*   **🧘‍♂️ Domain 2: The Line - Meditation** (<a href="https://github.com/Monada-Dominion/domain_2">Link</a>)
    *   Can be explored without preparation, but the need for theory from Domain 1 will emerge as you progress.

*   **🃏 Domain 3: The Triangel - Cards** (<a href="https://github.com/Monada-Dominion/domain_3">Link</a>)
    *   Will not fully reveal itself without completing Domains 1 and 2. However, it's always possible to create something new.

*   **🔒 Domain 4: The quadrangle - Algorithms**
    *   Not visible or available without the knowledge from all three preceding domains.

> Further steps are obscured but can be opened on demand. All currently available domains: (<a href="https://github.com/Monada-Dominion/domain_3">Link</a>)
