This subdirectory contains English and Russian materials for domain 1 of Monada Dominion - mindfitness and mindfulness. 

This domain is based on transformative program named SHINLAP, what translates from tibetan as blessing. 

It was designed to provide users with a minimal necessary amount of exercises, practices and theory to better understand Monada Dominion and the unviersal matrix. 

Yet, it is unfinished. If you'd like to translate anything, contribute, correct, dispute or change - you are welcome. 

Open issues, make your own branch, push and make a pull request.

Currently material needs a translation and editing. 

In the end we'd like to have 144 different cards with theory, practice and reflective questions.
