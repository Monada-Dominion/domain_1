        <h2>Module 1.1.1: Easy to be Biased, Difficult to be Critical. Unveiling Genuine Critical Thinking.</h2>

        <h3>1. What is <span class="highlight">Genuine Critical Thinking</span>?</h3>
        <p>
            Authentic critical thinking transcends ordinary cognitive processes, encouraging an unbiased and liberating mindset. It involves striving to overcome influences like bodily sensations, emotions, subconscious attitudes, past experiences, societal norms, celestial rhythms, and external stimuli that shape our thoughts. While achieving absolute freedom may seem challenging, it sparks philosophical reflections on the essence of genuine freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>*Celestial rhythms can imply influence of sun magnetism, moon cycles, Earth's place and seasons or other global states caused by celestial bodies movements.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>2. Why is <span class="highlight">Genuine Critical Thinking</span> Not Commonly Cultivated?</h3>
        <p>
            Though essential for self-understanding, genuine critical thinking seldom turns its gaze inward. Society frequently overlooks cultivating this vital skill, leaving individuals with biased perspectives about themselves and others. Influential figures and abstract concepts hold considerable sway, hampering the critical nature of our thoughts and perpetuating a state of being under the influence of others.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>*Society is considered to be a civilization in its general meaning.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Exploring <span class="highlight">Being</span> and <span class="highlight">Existence</span>: A Profound Distinction</h3>

        <h4>3. Exploring <span class="highlight">Being</span>:</h4>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Being</span> embraces the holistic essence of our existence – thoughts, feelings, physical state, relationships, past experiences, and spiritual growth. Attaining an elevated state enables us to rise above routine and access a deeper dimension for self-reflection, critical thinking, and departure from societal expectations.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Navigating <span class="highlight">Existence</span>:</h4>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Existence</span> revolves around routine, daily activities, work, family life, responsibilities, and future plans. While it may feel monotonous, it provides a framework within which we navigate our lives, offering a structure for daily interactions and pursuits.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Distinguishing Between <span class="highlight">Being</span> and <span class="highlight">Existence</span>:</strong><br>
            Recognizing this crucial difference empowers us to break free from societal expectations, engage in self-reflection, and explore deeper dimensions. Society's collective functioning can stifle individuality and growth, but this awareness catalyzes reclaiming our time, making conscious choices, and shaping authentic lives.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Attributes for Higher Level of <span class="highlight">Being</span></h3>
        <h3>6. Initiating a Transformative Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Deep within every individual lies the inherent potential to exist at a higher level of <span class="highlight">Being</span>, though often undiscovered. The hindrances are transient and can be overcome through conscious awareness. Rather than succumbing to repetitive life cycles, individuals can liberate themselves and embrace a vertical dimension of <span class="highlight">Being</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transforming this potential into reality demands intentional effort. Many navigate life guided by societal roles, subconscious patterns, or automatic behaviors, obscuring their authentic presence. Recognizing these as mere mechanics lacking control is vital, as they stem from internal reactions to external influences since birth.
        </p>
        <p>
            To initiate transformation, we must observe ourselves mindfully, attune to shifts within our level of <span class="highlight">Being</span>, embrace consistency, understand the essence of our <span class="highlight">Being</span>, seek knowledge, and foster a desire for growth.
        </p>

        <h3>7. The Growth of <span class="highlight">Consciousness</span> and <span class="highlight">Being</span></h3>
        <p>
            The growth of <span class="highlight">consciousness</span> and <span class="highlight">Being</span> involves seeking profound wholeness beyond mere existence. It entails liberation from external influences and dependencies, achieving purity and depth in perceiving the world. This growth integrates internal aspects, cultivates a conscious source of will, and shifts perspectives to enhance engagement with external spheres.
        </p>
        <p>
            Embarking on a new level is a deeply concrete undertaking encompassing all aspects of life – how we live, act, think, interact, sustain ourselves, and everything else within our existence. SHIN-LAP illuminates activating impartial critical thinking to gradually perceive something previously unnoticed, leading to glimpsing a higher level of <span class="highlight">Being</span> and the growth of <span class="highlight">consciousness</span>.
